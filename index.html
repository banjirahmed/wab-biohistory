            <p>For every programmer curiosity and the urge of being good at something is always the motivation. If you know why you want to learn web development, go challenge yourself, that is motivation enough. For me it was the desire to make and build my own website.</p>

            <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three fundamental pillars of Web Development. While HTML provides the structure, CSS provides the aural and visual layout for the page, and JavaScript is a higher-level programing language that is used to provide a better user experience. Knowledge in these three is basic for you to start a career in web development.</p>

             <p>A lot of developers consider this useless and a waste of time. For the small application, you can ignore writing tests but if you are building a large application we recommend you to write tests like unit tests and other types of the test because it helps in making your whole process robust and debugging become easier. </p>
